# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project demonstrates a variety of skills being applied in Excel, such as PivotTable, charts, Conditional Formatting, LOOKUP functions, functions, and some formatting skills to help make meaning of the dataset.

### Purpose
These are all done to help Louise have better visualization and help her to find the data needed for her goal. In this project, Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals, and all the work done here is sufficient for these requirements.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on Launch Date, the best time to launch campaigns for the "Theater" parent category is at June, since the amount of successful campaigns reached its highest at above 100 which is shown in the line chart. These campaigns don't even reach to 100 in number of successful outcomes in any other month. In addition, although the number of failed outcomes for June is also the highest out of all months, it is negligible comparing to the amount of successful campaigns. Half of the months have around 50 failed campaigns, which is around the number of failed outcomes for June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on Goals, successful outcomes are more than failed outcomes for the "Plays" subcategory when the goal is in the ranges of less than 1,000 to 15,0000, and of 35,000 to 45,0000. We know this based on the line chart comparing the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes. When the Percentage Successful line is above the Percentage Failed line, this shows the optimal goals to fundraise, and the ranges mentioned above are the optimal goal ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges was mainly in the COUNTIFS because the codes are pretty detailed, and if I mess up a key then the whole function would result in an error.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on Launch Date, the best time to launch campaigns for the "Theater" parent category is at June, since the amount of successful campaigns reached its highest at above 100 which is shown in the line chart. The number of failures are the highest in June out of all months, but it is negligible.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on Goals, successful outcomes are more than failed outcomes for the "Plays" subcategory when the goal is in the ranges of less than 1,000 to 15,0000, and of 35,000 to 45,0000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Maybe the date format and the separation of Product Category and Subcategory are the two limitations I can say, since they can be done before the dataset is handed to an analyst to prevent extra work.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create pie charts to show which kind of Category or Subcategory has the most successful outcomes, or most failed outcomes.
